+ *
+ * Typically this is meant to be used by the futex code.
+ *
+ * The main difference with get_user_pages() is that this function will
+ * unconditionally call handle_mm_fault() which will in turn perform all the
+ * necessary SW fixup of the dirty and young bits in the PTE, while
+ * handle_mm_fault() only guarantees to update these in the struct page.
+ *
+ * This is important for some architectures where those bits also gate the
+ * access permission to the page because they are maintained in software.  On
+ * such architectures, gup() will not be enough to make a subsequent access
+ * succeed.
+ *
+ * This should be called with the mm_sem held for read.
